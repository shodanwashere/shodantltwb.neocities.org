hey! :D
i finally finished up my computer setup, at least on my desk!

![](/img/posts/2025-10-22-mysetup/setup.jpg)

The setup is composed of a couple of components:

## 1. keyboard and mouse
The keyboard and mouse are both very beige coded and are from unexpected brands

First, the Keyboard is from the standard for pre-built keyboards nowadays, a Ducky Origin Vintage with MX Cherry Red Switches.

As is usual with Ducky keyboards, this one has a USB-C port at the top so the keyboard can be cordless during transport. The cable can also be changed if necessary.

The mouse is from Cherry, the company that MAKES MX Cherry switches (hehehe). It's a very basic USB Mouse known as the Cherry WheelMouse and is made to look like one of those vintage ball mouses. Not the greatest thing out there, but has been robust for my use cases and is pretty cheap.

## 2. monitor
The monitor is no longer sold around but it's a Fujitsu B-22W-7. This poor bastard is locked down to a max resolution of 1680x1050, aka, an Aspect Ratio of 16:10, a TN matte-panel and it only takes VGA (D-Sub), DVI and DisplayPort. For this situation, I am also using an active HDMI to DisplayPort adapter.

## 3. kvm switch
Now, I don't just use a single desktop or laptop. I use multiple machines on the same table and I HATE remoting into machines. For this reason, I use a KVM Switch. This KVM takes the input from all my peripherals, my keyboard, mouse, mic and webcam and output for the monitor, and redirects them all between either my desktop or a USB-C dock to which I connect either my personal MacBook Air or my work MacBook Pro. The switch is done by just clicking a button and honestly... it just works :)
