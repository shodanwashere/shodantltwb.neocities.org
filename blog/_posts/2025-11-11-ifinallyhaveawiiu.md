words cannot express how fucking happy i am right now. yes, you read the title right. 13 years after launch, 8 after it was discontinued, i finally - FINALLY - have a Wii U in my hands.

![](/img/posts/2025-11-11-ifinallyhaveawiiu/DSCN0239.JPG)

this console was part of my childhood but at the time it released, i was a snotty 12 year old brat and my family was not financially well, so i didn't have the guts to ask for one. we already had a Wii after all. asking for another was pushing it.

but ever since i was a kid, i was obsessed with this fucking thing. the gamepad seemed like magic. oh it is magic alright. dark fucking magic.

turns out there are many reasons why the wii u flopped hard. one is definitely the gamepad, and there are a miriad of reasons for this:
- the first and most agregious of all is the fact that this giant fucking gamepad, with a TOUCH SCREEN ON IT mind you, as a battery life of a whopping... 1550 mAh. That's around 3-5 hours of play time if your battery is not degraded already. i already have plans to swap mine for a 6000 mAh battery, but this is already a handicap on most. it's also kind of weird how Nintendo's own official "High Capacity Battery" for the Wii U is only 2550 mAh. it's like they didn't want you to play this thing. which leads me to my next point:
- excessive tethering! Seriously! the wii u is so clingy with the gamepad, it needs it for EVERYTHING. there are specifically things that it will refuse to start up if you do not have a functional gamepad. things like,
    - the settings!
    - the Mii Editor!
    - several fucking games on its library!
    - YouTube!
    - etc.
- finally, for a console that bitches and moans about needing the gamepad for everything, it sure is underutilized in its games. Rayman Legends and Nintendo Land seem to be standout contradictions to this, as a lot of their mechanics were built with gamepad functionality in mind, but everything else is so... lackluster. Bayonetta only uses the gamepad as a second screen, but will REFUSE to start up without the gamepad connected. New Super Mario Bros. U only uses the gamepad as a crutch to place blocks for other players if they get stuck. Breath of the Wild straight up has no gamepad functionality other than a couple of shrines where it uses the gamepad's gyroscope for those weird ball maze puzzles. that's it. this console had a lot of potential and Nintendo just left that potential gathering dust, and it resulted in a couple of lackluster games.

speaking of, the games. they're not bad, but the library here is quite small in terms of exclusive Wii U titles. i'm still trying out some and currently i think, gamepad usage aside, New Super Mario Bros. U and Mario Kart 8 are the stand outs. 8 Deluxe is way better than Mario Kart 8, but this one has its own merits. and New Mario U has a lot of character. yes, it is borrowing from the New Mario Bros. art style, but there's a lot here that is its own thing, with zones that have very unique mechanics, art styles, and a more challenging level of platforming that one-ups New Mario Bros. Wii, and stands shoulder to shoulder with New Super Mario Bros. 2 - which makes me wonder why the two never had any sort of wireless connection between the Wii U and the 3DS, but i digress.

Anyway, I'm gonna keep letting my inner child have some fun. Be back in a few!
