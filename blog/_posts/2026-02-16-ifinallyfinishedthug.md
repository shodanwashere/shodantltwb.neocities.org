oh my god i finally finished tony hawk's underground and this is probably one of the best games ever. it's pretty rough around the edges but its to be expected from an arcadey and more interconnected experience.
i will say, though, there are a couple of sections in this game that are severe bullshit, and the one that pissed me most off was the last line: Eric Sparrow's "epic" line in New Jersey

this line will take you around the entire town and test a number of different skills, from holding grinds to successfully and accurately making jumps over large gaps, both horizontally and vertically, and just simply not bailing all the fucking time.

if you want a feeling for how hard this fucking line is, here's a video by @Skifts of him completing that line on Sick Difficulty in one continuous combo:

in short, rest in piss, Eric Sparrow. let us meet again in Underground 2 so i can kick your ass again
