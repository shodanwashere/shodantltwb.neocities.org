              <li>Secondly, their office suite. Do not use Microsoft Word, Excel or PowerPoint. A good alternative is the LibreOffice suite;</li>
              <li>Microsoft Teams, which was launched as a bid to erase Slack from the competition. A good alternative is of course Slack, but they're owned by Salesforce, who are dabbling in Generative AI;</li>
              <li>Microsoft Outlook as an e-mail provider, for which you can use Proton as an alternative; and Outlook as an e-mail client, for which you should optimally access email only from your browser;</li>
              <li>Visual Studio Code for development. Alternatives exist like Sublime, and for more professional work, Vim and Neovim;</li>
              <li>Microsoft OneNote for note taking and collaboration. Alternatives like Obsidian are local first and have great free tiers;</li>
              <li>Skype, MSN and Bing. Nobody really uses these but I want them in the list;</li>
              <li>XBOX and XBOX Game Pass. This is the easiest to boycott.</li>

              <li>Even with the boycott, Windows is still a critical piece of computer Infrastructure in today's day and age. As such efforts are still being made to: 1. Find ways to unlawfully activate Windows installs and; 2. Counter Microsoft's attempts to curb the creation of local accounts on Windows 11. Collaborate for these two goals.</li>
              <li>As Microsoft will always have another feature planned for tomorrow, find ways to remove as much bloat from Microsoft as possible. This includes but is not limited to:</li>
