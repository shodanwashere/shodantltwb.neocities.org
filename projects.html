    <p><b>Vinland Valley</b> is a (since) deprecated base script I wrote to transfer hosts in Stardew Valley multiplayer save files. It's a known problem with Stardew Valley that you can't just transfer ownership of a multiplayer save file to another player if you decide you don't want to play on that farm anymore. The developer never gave an easy solution for this, so I thought I'd write my own. The result, at the time was very experimental and caused a ton of problems, especially in regards to house and wine cellar ownership, etc.</p>
    <p>Try it out at your own risk. If you do, please open an issue on the repository if you find whatever bugs occur.</p>
